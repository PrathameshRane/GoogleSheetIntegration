This Project is for reading and writing data to the Google Spreadsheet.(Open this project in Netbeans)
I have used Google Sheets API v4 for this.
You can check the guidlines to use Google Sheets API from this link:https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/java
You will have to install Groovy & Grails and Gradle support plugins in Netbeans IDE.
